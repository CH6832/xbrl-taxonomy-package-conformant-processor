# XBRL Taxonomy Package Conformant Processor

## :newspaper: About the project

A small command line program that checks whether an XBRL Taxonomy Package complies with the [Standard Taxonomy Package 1.0](https://www.xbrl.org/Specification/taxonomy-package/REC-2016-04-19/taxonomy-package-REC-2016-04-19.html) and adjusts it if necessary.

### How it works

1. Run for example `app.py EDINET "full/path/to/input/archive.zip"`. The `app.py` file is the starting point of the application. `EDINET` represents the Electronic Disclosure System provided by the [JFSA](https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/). The path afterwards can be any path locating an XBRL Taxonomy Package (ZIP). In this case `EDINET` is the abbreveation of the taxonomy package provider and `full/path/to/archive.zip` is the path to the zip archive. Packages to test/to experiment with the application are located in the `input`-folder.

2. The class `Checker` class in `TPChecker.py` analyzes the package according to the [Taxonomy Package 1.0 standard](https://www.xbrl.org/Specification/taxonomy-package/REC-2016-04-19/taxonomy-package-REC-2016-04-19.html). The result of the analyzation is displayed on the command line.

3. Based on the result calculated by the `Checker`-class, the next step is to fix the package. `TPFixer.py` contains an Interface with relevant abstract methods. Each class represents a package by a specific provider. When the class is initialized, the package to fix will be copied over to the `output`-folder. The definied methods from the Interface are responsible for fixing the package. The result of the fixed package will be a fixed `zip` archive containing all relevant data.

## :runner: Getting started

### Prerequisites and example usage

0. Install requirements:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Run script:

```sh
python3 app.py [PROVIDER] [PATH/TO/PKG]
```

```sh
python3 app.py EDINET "input/ALL_20221101/ALL_20221101.zip"
```

```sh
Input information:
------------------
    Provider -> EDINET
    Package  -> ..\input\ALL_20221101\ALL_20221101.zip

Analyzis results:
------------------
    DONE: Package is ZIP
    ERROR: Package has not single toplevel dir
    ERROR: Package has no META-INF folder
    ERROR: Package has no catalog.xml
    ERROR: Package has no taxonomy-package.xml

Fixing package...
    META-INF directory generated
    Top level directory generated
    Package content restructured
    catalog.xml file generated
    catalog.xml is xml file
    taxonomyPackage.xml file generated
    taxonomyPackage.xml is xml file
    Final zip generated

Output result:
--------------
    ..\output\ALL_20221101\ALL_20221101.zip is fixed!
```

### Build and install the `.whl` package

0. Upgrade packages:

```sh
py -m pip install --upgrade build 
```

1. Build package:

```sh
py -m build 
```

2. Install the package:

```sh
py -m pip install "dist/example_package_CHRISTOPH_HARTLEB-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
```

### Run tests

0. Move into `tests/` folder

```sh
py run_tests.py
```

1. Or you can run every test separately as well:

```sh
pytest test_EBAFixer.py
```

### Create documentation

0. Move into `docs/` folder

```sh
cd docs
```

1. Initilaize project:

```sh
sphinx-quickstart 
```

2. Build/rebuild the documentation:

```sh
make html
```

## :bulb: Tips and Tricks

    Use absolute paths for input XBRL taxonomy packages to avoid any path-related issues.
    Ensure your input packages adhere to the XBRL Taxonomy Package 1.0 standard for accurate processing.

## :wrench: Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the tool, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Check if all prerequisites are installed correctly.
- Verify that the input XBRL taxonomy package is valid and adheres to the required format.
- Refer to the error messages for clues on what might be going wrong.
- Search for similar issues in the project's GitHub repository or online forums.
